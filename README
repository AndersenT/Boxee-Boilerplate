To get started. Get to the Boxee apps dir in a terminal:

mkdir developer-id.your-app-id (developer-id should be your unique prefix, mine is 'greatboxee')
cd developer-id.your-app-id
git init
git remote add boilerplate git://github.com/tommysqueak/Boxee-Boilerplate.git
git pull boilerplate master

Then open up the descriptor.xml in your editor of choice and fill in the blanks. Open Boxee and check it runs ok. Make a kick-ass app.

If you're using Git for source control, rename example.gitignore to .gitignore

For building the app
You'll need Ruby and bundler installed.
Open build/environments.yml and fill in the blanks
From a terminal:
cd build
bundle install
rake

This will create to packaged apps. One for deployment to your staging server/repository and one for the official Boxee app library.
